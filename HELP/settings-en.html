            <p id="card3-text" class="card-text">CBX Tools is a utility program designed to assist in converting and
                optimizing common comic book file formats, including CBR, CBZ, and PDF. CBX Tools aims to preserve
                image resolution and DPI settings as much as possible, ensuring virtually lossless conversion and
                optimization for high-quality results.</p>
            <div class="content">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Language:</strong> Select the interface language (English or Turkish). The language
                        setting is applied immediately after saving the dialog.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>JPEG Quality:</strong> Set the quality of JPEG images (10â€“100). This setting is used
                        during PDF-to-CBR conversion for JPEG images or formats like PBM, PGM, and PPM that require
                        conversion to JPEGs. Values above 80 significantly increase file size without visible quality
                        improvement. For optimal quality and smaller file sizes, a value between 70 and 80 is
                        recommended. Default is 80.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>JPEG DPI:</strong> Specify the resolution for JPEG images in DPI (150, 300, 400, 600).
                        This is applied during PDF-to-CBR conversion for JPEG images or formats like PBM, PGM, and PPM
                        that require conversion to JPEGs. Values of 400 and above significantly increase file size. For
                        a balance of quality and file size, 300 DPI is recommended. The default value is 300.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>JPEG Optimization:</strong> Select the tool for optimizing (reducing file sizes without
                        compromising resolution or DPI) JPEG images.<br>
                        <strong>Disabled:</strong> Leaves JPEG files unchanged.<br> <strong>jpegoptim.exe:</strong> A
                        free
                        tool included in CBX Tools,
                        providing lossless optimization via Huffman table adjustments.<br> <strong>JPEGmini
                            Pro:</strong> A
                        paid tool that
                        reduces file size without sacrificing quality, offering better and faster results than
                        jpegoptim. This tool must be installed and set up as per the <a
                            href="getting-started-tr.html">Getting Started</a> section.<br>
                        <strong>Manual:</strong>
                        Pauses the process, prompting the user to optimize files manually. Click 'OK' to continue after
                        completion.
                    </li><br>
                    <li><strong>Solid Archive:</strong> Enable or disable solid archiving in RAR compression. Default
                        is No (Disable).<br>

                        A solid archive is a type of compression where multiple files are treated as a single continuous
                        block during the compression process. This method can provide better compression ratios,
                        especially for collections of similar files, as it allows for more efficient storage of shared
                        data between files.<br>

                        Using a solid archive may help reduce the file size of large comic book files, resulting in
                        smaller overall sizes. However, the effect might be negligible for comic files under 150 pages.
                        Additionally, enabling solid archiving can reduce file recoverability compared to regular
                        compression with the same percentage of recovery record. In case of file corruption, recovery
                        might be more challenging with solid archives..</li><br>
                    <li><strong>Recovery Record (%):</strong> Specify the percentage of recovery data for RAR archives.
                        (3%-10%).<br>
                        A recovery record is a data set added to an archive to help recover the archive in case of
                        corruption. When a RAR archive is created with a recovery record, a portion of the archive is
                        dedicated to storing error correction information. This allows the user to repair the archive if
                        part of it becomes damaged or unreadable.

                        The percentage (3%-10%) determines how much of the archive's total size is allocated for
                        recovery purposes. A higher percentage increases the chances of successfully recovering data
                        from a corrupted archive but also increases the file size.<br> The default value is 5%, offering
                        a
                        balance between compression and recoverability.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>Output Folder Path:</strong> Specify the path where the OUTPUT folder, where the final
                        files will be saved, is created. <br>

                        The output folder is where the processed or modified files will be stored once the operation
                        (like compression or optimization) is completed. CBX Tools ensures that the original source
                        files remain unchanged and intact in their original location. Only the new or modified versions
                        of the files are placed in the specified output folder. This keeps the source files safe while
                        allowing you to work with the new results separately.<br><br>
                        For example, if the Output Folder Path is set to C:\users\abc\Desktop, the processed files will
                        be placed under C:\users\abc\Desktop\OUTPUT. If the OUTPUT folder does not exist, it will be
                        created automatically. If the OUTPUT folder already exists and contains files, the existing
                        folder will be renamed, and a new C:\users\abc\Desktop\OUTPUT folder will be created to store
                        the processed files. This ensures that the final files are always placed in a fresh, dedicated
                        folder without overwriting existing files.
                    </li><br>
                    <li><strong>WinRAR Path:</strong> Specify the path of the WinRAR executable. Default is C:\Program
                        Files\WinRAR\</li><br>
                    <li><strong>JPEGmini Path:</strong> Specify the path of the JPEGmini application. This is required
                        if JPEGmini is selected in the JPEG Optimization box.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>Verbose Info Mode:</strong> Enable or disable detailed output (Yes/No).</li>
