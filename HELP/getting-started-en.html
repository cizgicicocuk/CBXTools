            <h5><strong>What is CBX Tools?</strong></h5>
            <p id="card3-text" class="card-text">CBX Tools is a utility program designed to assist in converting and
                optimizing common comic book file formats, including CBR, CBZ, and PDF. CBX Tools aims to preserve
                image resolution and DPI settings as much as possible, ensuring virtually lossless conversion and
                optimization for high-quality results.</p>
            <div class="content">
                <p><strong>CBX Tools</strong> offers three main functions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>CBR/CBZ Optimization</strong> – Optimizes CBR and CBZ comic book files by converting
                        them into RAR files with recovery records. Optionally, it enhances JPEG images using the
                        included jpegoptim or external JPEGMini Pro. The final file is saved with a CBR extension.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>CBR/CBZ to PDF Conversion</strong> – Converts CBR and CBZ files into PDF format.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>PDF to CBR/CBZ Conversion</strong> – Converts PDF files into CBR format.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="spacing">
                <h5><strong>Requirements</strong></h5>
                <p>CBX Tools uses <a href="https://www.win-rar.com" target="_blank">WinRAR</a> for
                    extracting and compressing CBR/CBZ files, as it is the fastest
                    application for ZIP extraction and RAR operations. Thererfore, WinRAR must be installed on the
                    computer. Since it is not free software, it cannot be bundled with CBX Tools.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="spacing">
                <h5><strong>Optional Requirements</strong></h5>
                <p>CBX Tools can utilize <a href="https://jpegmini.com/" target="_blank">JPEGMini
                        Pro</a> for JPEG optimizations, significantly reducing the size of JPEG files while
                    preserving their resolution and image quality. JPEGMini Pro must be
                    installed separately, as it is not free software and cannot be included with CBX Tools.</p>

                    <strong>1.</strong> Drag-and-<strong>Drop Areas (1, 2, and 3)</strong>
                    <p>These are the primary zones where users can drag and drop files, folders or both for processing.
                        Each drop area corresponds to a specific function:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Area 1:</strong> Designed for <strong>CBR/CBZ Optimization</strong> tasks, enabling

                            compromising quality.</li>
                        <li><strong>Area 2:</strong> Used for converting <strong>PDF to CBR</strong>, allowing seamless
                            conversion of PDF files into comic book formats.</li>
                        <li><strong>Area 3:</strong> Handles <strong>CBR/CBZ to PDF</strong> conversions, enabling users

                <h5><strong>Operations</strong></h5>

                <div class="section">
                    <strong>1. CBR and CBZ Optimizations</strong>
                    <p>All CBR and CBZ files within the files and/or folders dropped into this box undergo a series of
                        operations to enhance efficiency and reliability. Other file formats will be ignored. First, the
                        files are extracted using WinRAR.
                        If JPEG Optimization is enabled in the Settings menu, all JPEG files are optimized to save
                        storage space while preserving resolution and DPI values, using the selected method. For
                        optimization with JPEGMini Pro, the program must be installed and configured as outlined in the
                        Optional section, whereas jpegoptim requires no additional setup. JPEGMini Pro removes
                        unnecessary
                        image information, such as details and color data that are less perceptible to the human eye,
                        achieving up to 50% space savings on some files while maintaining high visual quality. if
                        selected, jpegoptim operates in a similar manner, although the space savings it achieves are
                        typically smaller. This free tool is fully integrated with CBX Tools. Finally, the
                        optimized images and any auxiliary files with an XML extension are recompiled into a CBR file
                        using WinRAR, incorporating a recovery record as specified in the Settings menu. This recovery
                        record is a critical feature that helps restore data if the archive becomes corrupted, allowing
                        missing or damaged information to be repaired, even if part of the CBR file is compromised.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="section">
                    <strong>2. PDF to CBR Conversion</strong>
                    <p>When converting PDF files to CBR, you can drop files, folders or a combination of files and
                        folders into
                        this box. Only PDF files will be processed; other file formats will be ignored. Based on the
                        content of each PDF file, the most suitable method is used to extract the pages as images. File
                        formats like JPX, PBM, PGM, and PPM are converted into JPEG format, while PNG and BMP files
                        remain unchanged. If JPEG Optimization is enabled in the Settings menu, all JPEG files are
                        optimized using the selected method to save storage space while preserving their resolution and
                        DPI. Finally, the optimized image files are converted into a CBR file with a recovery record, as
                        specified in the Settings menu, using WinRAR.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="section">
                    <strong>3. CBR/CBZ to PDF Conversion</strong>
                    <p>When converting CBR/CBZ files to PDFs, you can drop files, folders or a combination of files and
                        folders
                        into this box. Only CBR and CBZ files will be processed; all other file formats will be ignored.
                        The selected CBR and CBZ files are first extracted using WinRAR. If JPEG Optimization is enabled
                        in the Settings menu, all JPEG files are optimized using the chosen method to reduce their size
                        while keeping the resolution and DPI intact. Finally, the optimized image files are converted
                        into a PDF.</p>
