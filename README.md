# CBX-Tools
CBX Tools is a utility program designed to assist in converting and optimizing common comic book file formats, including CBR, CBZ, and PDF. CBX Tools aims to preserve image resolution and DPI settings as much as possible, ensuring virtually lossless conversion and optimization for high-quality results.

# CBX Tools offers three main functions:

CBR/CBZ Optimization – Optimizes CBR and CBZ comic book files by converting them into RAR files with recovery records. Optionally, it enhances JPEG images using the included jpegoptim or external JPEGMini Pro. The final file is saved with a CBR extension.

CBR/CBZ to PDF Conversion – Converts CBR and CBZ files into PDF format.

PDF to CBR/CBZ Conversion – Converts PDF files into CBR format.

# Requirements
CBX Tools uses WinRAR for extracting and compressing CBR/CBZ files, as it is the fastest application for ZIP extraction and RAR operations. Thererfore, WinRAR must be installed on the computer. Since it is not free software, it cannot be bundled with CBX Tools.

# Optional Requirements
CBX Tools can utilize JPEGMini Pro for JPEG optimizations, significantly reducing the size of JPEG files while preserving their resolution and image quality. JPEGMini Pro must be installed separately, as it is not free software and cannot be included with CBX Tools.
